# Arduino Motion Alarm System
### Final Project â€” Physics 11

## Scope & Purpose
I developed a motion alarm system on Arduino using sensor MPU-6050. This sensor incorporates 3-axis gyroscope and accelerometer, allowing to calculate the angle. Using complementrary filtering the data is being polished and later used to activate the alarm. The system is taped to the door (at 0 degrees angle), and at the moment when the door opens and reaches angle of 5 degrees the active buzzer turns on.
